# Weatherly

This is a weather forecast application developed to practice JavaScript, API usage, DOM manipulation, and asynchronous programming. It allows users to search for the current weather, hourly forecast, and daily forecast of a specific location. It also displays upcoming events in the area and keeps a search history for quick access to previously searched locations. Users can switch between metric and imperial units.

It was an [assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-weather-app) from The Odin Project curriculum.
